using c#
    Create a function that accepts a string as a parameter and can filter by country `name/common`.  

    The filter should search for countries names that contains string from attributes (e.g. providing `st` as attribute I could find `Estonia`, providing `Sp` I could find `Spain`) 

    search should be case insensitive (e.g., providing `sT` should find `Estonia`)
